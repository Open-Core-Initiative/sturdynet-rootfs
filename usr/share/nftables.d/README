This directory may contain partial nftables files which are automatically
included into the nftables ruleset generated by the fw4 program.

Only accessible files (no broken symlinks, no files with insufficient
permissions) with an `*.nft` file extension are considered.

The include position of each file within the overall ruleset is derived
from the file path:

 - Files in ./ruleset-pre/ and ./ruleset-post/ are included before and
   after the `table inet fw4 { ... }` declaration respectively

 - Files in ./table-pre/ and ./table-post/ are included before the first
   chain and after the last chain declaration within the fw4 table
   respectively

 - Files in ./chain-pre/${chain}/ and ./chain-post/${chain}/ are included
   before the first and after the last rule within the mentioned chain of
   the fw4 table respectively

Automatic inclusion of these files can be disabled by setting the global
`auto_includes` option to `0` within the defaults section of
/etc/config/firewall.
